#The specification calls for the use of a connection object to manage the connection to the database 
# cursor objects to manage the interaction with the database, for fetching data from
# the database and updating its contents

# The other advantage is that itâ€™s fairly easy to prototype an application using a lightweight database and then switch the application over
# to a production database after the basic design of the application has been finalized
